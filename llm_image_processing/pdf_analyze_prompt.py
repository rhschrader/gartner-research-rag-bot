Create a clear, information-rich summary (maximum 500 words) that includes:
• All key concepts, themes, and author insights

• Interpretations of any charts, diagrams, tables, and infographics
• Definitions, frameworks, models, and recommendations if present
• Any implications or risks mentioned

2. Preserve all quantitative details (percentages, projections, growth rates, financial figures) and directional trends from visuals.
3. Paraphrase text into fluent prose; do not copy large sections verbatim.
4. Summarize tables and charts by stating their key insights and patterns.
4b. Extract and retain and quantitative data from tables and charts.
5. Interpret diagrams or frameworks briefly, focusing on relationships or process flow.
6. Remove filler or repetitive phrasing—prioritize facts, insights, and their implications.
7. Do NOT exceed 500 words.
8. The output must be self-contained: no references to “this page” or “the image.”

--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---
• Start with a one-sentence overview summarizing the main purpose or theme of the page.
• Follow with a concise narrative integrating all important information and numeric data.
• Include interpretations of visual elements where relevant.
• Conclude with any stated implications, recommendations, or key takeaways.
