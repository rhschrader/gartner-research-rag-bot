This remains true when communicating IT investments to\nthe business. The metrics and benchmarks that Gartner has identified here provide a high-\nlevel view of current trends in IT by industry. They also reveal trends in business\nalignment, staffing, technology and outsourcing. They can be used to assist in\ncommunicating alignment with the business and in evaluating targets in key technology\nareas. They provide context for key business decisions and internal performance\nmeasures.

Recommendations\n■ Identify the initial maturity state for DevSecOps by evaluating the characteristics and\nscenarios in this maturity model as a comparative framework.\n■ Foster collaboration between engineering and security teams by establishing a\ncommunity of practice (CoP) that continuously aligns shared objectives toward\nimproving DevSecOps maturity.\n■ Empower software teams to achieve higher levels of DevSecOps maturity by\nestablishing enabling teams to provide resources, coaching and mentoring.

Developer Enablement\nCore to developer enablement is reducing dependencies on external teams. Gartner survey\ndata shows that when software engineering staff are more directly involved in activities\ntraditionally owned by cybersecurity, there are better security outcomes. 2 Being directly\ninvolved does not necessarily mean that software engineering owns all security concerns. Cross-collaboration with cybersecurity and I&O teams helps prop up software engineers to\nconduct work on their value stream with little direct dependencies acting as a constraint.

It also examines how software engineering leaders anticipate change in their operating budgets and the cost management steps taken. It further aims to identify the quality and testing techniques and programming languages software engineering leaders\ncurrently use and/or plan to use; their frequency of usage of UX design, user research and AI in generating components of user experience; and its impact on user satisfaction, accessibility and usability. It also intends to understand the software engineering leaders’ responsibilities they ﬁnd most difﬁcult, the career paths available for senior-level\nindividual contributors and how they are set up, how organizations attract and retain top performers in those career paths, and what management training is offered to staff.

This survey was conducted to identify\nthe most important roles and skills for software engineering leaders and the change in\ntheir demand and importance since last year, understand how talent is sourced generally\nand for acquiring necessary artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) skills, and\nwhat tools are seen to increase developer productivity and the metrics used to measure\nthem. It also examines how software engineering leaders anticipate change in their\noperating budgets and the cost management steps taken. It further aims to identify the\nquality and testing techniques and programming languages software engineering leaders\ncurrently use and/or plan to use; their frequency of usage of UX design, user research and\nAI in generating components of user experience; and its impact on user satisfaction,\naccessibility and usability. It also intends to understand the software engineering leaders’\nresponsibilities they find most difficult, the career paths available for senior-level\nindividual contributors and how they are set up, how organizations attract and retain top\nperformers in those career paths, and what management training is offered to staff. The\nsurvey was conducted online from October through December 2023 among 300\nrespondents from the U.S. (n = 241) and the U.K. (n = 59). Qualifying organizations\noperated in multiple industries (excluding the IT software industry and education sector)\nand reported enterprisewide revenue for fiscal year 2022 of at least $250 million or\nequivalent, with 63% over $1 billion in revenue. Qualified participants were highly involved\nin managing software engineering/application development teams and the activities they\nperform.

This survey was conducted\nonline from 7 June through 14 July 2023. It sought to understand the different aspects of\nsecurity practices, such as responsibilities, skills, metrics, requirements, processes, tools\nand technologies, and security roles in software engineering. In total, 300 software\nengineers and security professionals, up to the role of senior vice president, across\nindustries participated. The respondents were from North America (n = 178), EMEA (n =\n76) and Asia/Pacific (n = 46).

Contact center AI assistant (internal) Using analytics and GenAI tools for supporting contact center agents. Activities include speech analytics for context and expertise-based call routing, automated note taking (including sentiment analysis), and summarized transcripts of customer conversations to reduce postcall effort. Natural-language-based queries allow agents to easily locate specific pieces of information in product and policy documentation and deliver a more personalized experience to customers. Revenue:  Facilitates cross-selling and upselling opportunities as agents can tailor banking product recommendations and support to specific customer needs. Efficiency:  Streamlines workflows, supports agents with real-time information, automates routine tasks such as creating call summaries, and decreases the need for extensive training for new agents. Risk management:  Reduce the risk of exposing customers to model hallucinations as data that is shared with the contact center AI assistant is controlled. Customer experience:  Improves service delivery with quicker responses (reduces average call handling time), personalized customer interactions and better first call resolution. Technical:  Vendor LLM models that can assist agents by interpreting customer inquiries, suggesting responses, providing real-time information and summarizing customer conversations are widely available. Internal:  Banks deploying these solutions are starting to see productivity gains for their contact center operations. Staff members need to be educated on the benefits and functionalities of the AI assistants, and user feedback should be used to assuage any concerns. External:  Ensuring that customers perceive the AI assistant as a tool that enhances service quality and protects customer data is essential for increased adoption.

Analysis\nCreate the Process Workflow that Identifies All of the Decision Stages\nThroughout the Asset Life Cycle\nWhile the high level need of organizations relating to asset management is relatively the\nsame, the details of how assets are managed can vary. For this reason, we advise clients\nthat one of the most important tasks when starting the asset management journey or\nupdating their asset management process is to gather the stakeholders and create/review\nthe basic workflow asset life cycle. Some processes may be primarily concerned with the\ninventory of assets based on an audit but it is paramount that the workflow contains the\nentire asset life cycle for the organization. Accounting for all of the decisions each\ndiffering asset will have during its lifetime. Asset Management Strategies Often Have Coverage Gaps\nThese coverage gaps are opportunities for assets (technology and nontechnology) to\ndisappear. For example, departments often will requisition an asset (such as a\nsmartphone or laptop) through procurement. However, once the asset arrives, there is no\nprocess to connect asset procurement and delivery to the asset management application. We recommend that this be an automated process between the procurement and asset\nmanagement applications, and that there be a physical, locked location where the\nequipment is stored. Often, adding an asset to the asset management application is manual, and the asset sits\nin shipping until someone from the department that ordered it is called or it is delivered to\nthe department. The process must be designed to address the issues associated with\nmultiple constituents — in IT, finance, operations and the requesting department — as\nshown in Figure 1.

Trial: First proof-of-concept initiatives should be underway for select business units that\nwould be most impacted by this technology trend. Evaluation of these technologies,\nwhether they succeed or fail, will provide insight into potential business impacts and\nfurther expansion across the organization. Assess: Emerging technology trends are represented in this category. These technologies\nshould be under assessment with the R&D and innovation teams as they may not be fully\nmature in your industry, but their potential transformational impact is such that they\nshould be considered for evaluation.\n© 2025 Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates.
